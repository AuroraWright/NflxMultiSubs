# Installation instructions
As of 2021-10-08 the Chrome store release hasn't been updated yet, 
so you can use these instructions to install the extension.
**Once the Chrome/Firefox stores have been updated, please reinstall the extension from there.**

Chrome
----
1) Download the zip for Chrome from
   the [Release](https://github.com/gmertes/NflxMultiSubs/releases/latest) page
2) Create a folder somewhere called `NflxMultiSubs` .
   You can put this folder anywhere, for example in your My Documents folder
3) Extract the contents of the zip file into this folder you just created
4) In a new Chrome tab, type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press enter
5) In the top right corner, click the box next to **Developer mode** to turn it on
6) Now click on the **Load Unpacked** button, a file browser will pop up
7) Browse to the location of the `NflxMultiSubs` folder that you just created,
   select it and press **Select Folder**

That's it, the extension should now be installed!

Firefox
----

**NOTE:** Due to the way Firefox handles unpacked extensions, this is only a temporary installation.
The extension will be removed the next time you restart the browser.

1) Download the zip for Firefox from
   the [Release](https://github.com/gmertes/NflxMultiSubs/releases/latest) page
2) In a new Firefox tab, type `about:debugging` in the address bar and press enter
3) Click on **This Firefox** on the left side of the page
4) In the middle under Temporary Extensions, click on **Load Temporary Addon-on**
5) Browse to the location of the zip file you just downloaded (e.g.: your Downloads folder)
6) Select the zip file and click **Open**

That's it, the extension should now be installed!
